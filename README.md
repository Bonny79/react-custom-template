# react-custom-template
If you are looking to speed up the process of creating new react projects with the same structure, maybe you need to have a look at the react custom template.
Here I have a created a custom template based on typescript with a configured eslint to keep your code as clean as possible. Even more, this template defines the atomic structure, in order to keep a good understanding on where we are in the project during the development process.

## How to
Just open your terminal, maybe in your workspace folder and just type the same as you always do when you need to create a react application so:
npx create-react-app <your-app-name> --template @bonny879/cra-template
