# react-custom-template
If you are looking to speed up the process of creating new react projects with the same structure, maybe you need to have a look at the react custom template.
Here I have a created a custom template based on typescript with a configured eslint to keep your code as clean as possible. Even more, this template defines the atomic structure, in order to keep a good understanding on where we are in the project during the development process.

## How to
Clone this repo and run this command at the top level (so outside template folder) <npx create-react-app app-name --template file:.>
Soon I will create a npm account where I will publish this template, so this process will be avoided.
